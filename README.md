# mini-autorizador
An application that simulates a card authorizer

Criation about one process test in VR Company.

The project was created using an MVC scruture.

The Business rule is:

Build a *mini-authorizer*. This will be a Spring Boot application with a full REST interface that allows:

* creating cards (all cards must be created with an initial balance of R$500.00)
* getting card balance
* authorizing transactions using previously created cards as a means of payment

*About the Coverage:*
The important coverage was created in Test files, was ServiceImpl because I didn't only pass the code but was tested too.


I changed the configuration in docker-compose but in the gitHub will be the same that you put in the example.
